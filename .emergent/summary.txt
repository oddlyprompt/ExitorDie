The AI engineer's work trajectory is a detailed account of bug fixing, refactoring, and feature implementation for the Exit or Die game. Initially, the engineer resolved critical frontend loading issues, including a host blocking error and a tricky timing-related bug in the TitleScene. A significant portion of the work involved diagnosing and fixing core gameplay mechanics: non-functional buttons, missing room content (due to a missing  method), broken milestone room advancement (due to depth not updating), and a complete overhaul of the procedural item name generation logic (addressing empty data arrays). The engineer then tackled crucial backend integration issues related to score submission, accurately matching frontend data with backend Pydantic models, and correctly populating the  for server-side score validation. Finally, a comprehensive audio system with volume controls and background music was implemented and debugged, alongside numerous small bug fixes and debugging enhancements (e.g., Eruda console). The latest fix addressed a  where  was an object instead of an array.

<product_requirements>
The goal is to develop Exit or Die, a mobile-first, browser-based roguelike using Phaser 3 (frontend) and FastAPI/MongoDB (backend). Key features include seven game scenes, core mechanics (HP, Greed, deterministic RNG, loot system, room modifiers), and backend integration for content packs, daily seeds, paginated leaderboards, and server-authoritative score validation via replay logs.

**Implemented Features (v1.0.2 & v1.1.0 sprints):**
*   **Core Polish**: Deterministic roulette wheel, item card pop-ups, procedural flavor text, refined game balance (room target, HP, curves, pity system), and consumables (Smoke Bomb, Field Bandage).
*   **v1.1.0 Sprint**: Main menu (username, custom seed, play seed button), Safe first two rooms, death-risk smoothing, milestone rooms (boosted drops, forks), equip/bank system for artifacts, procedural item naming (1000+ combinations), HUD cleanup, backend adjustments for username, custom seeds, content pack v1.1.0.

**New Sprint Requirements (Equip Effects, Lore & Audio, Desktop Alignment):**
*   **Equip System**: Two equip slots (E1, E2) wired into  for additive/multiplicative effects (risk, exit, rarity, loot chance, greed delta, heal on milestone, revive, skip, heal charges). Revive prevents death. Tooltips summarize effects. UI for equipping/banking, HUD icons for active effects.
*   **Lore & Discovery**: 1-2 sentence  for artifacts in Codex/item cards. Expanded room flavor text. NEW ENTRY banner on first artifact discovery.
*   **Audio**: Loopable ambient music (user-provided ), respecting iOS gesture. Music/SFX volume controls (0-100) persistent in localStorage. Fade-in/out. SFX for wheel tick, loot chime, trap, heal, equip, milestone, death.
*   **Desktop Alignment & Fonts**: Phaser  (target 1024x576), centered canvas, CSS safe-area paddings. UI Scale option (Small/Normal/Large). Larger fonts for choice buttons on desktop, shadows/outlines for HUD text. Layering fix: Greed bar below HP, right-aligned Exit/Risk.
*   **Content Pack Deltas**: Add  and effect IDs to artifacts (e.g., , , ).
*   **Procedural Name Generator**: Expand lists for 1,000+ unique names per 5,000 drops (seeded, no in-run duplicates). Tier bias for higher rarity prefixes/suffixes. Names in item card and Codex.
*   **Leaderboard Usernames**: Store username in localStorage, include in . Auto-generate Wanderer#### if blank.
*   **Acceptance Criteria**: Detailed tests for equip effects, revive, milestone heal, audio behavior, desktop scaling, and procedural name uniqueness.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was in a debugging loop to fix critical issues related to leaderboard score submission and music playback. The user reported that scores were still not appearing on the leaderboard and that the background music was stacking/doubling.

The engineer meticulously debugged the leaderboard issue, first discovering that  was being submitted as an empty array, which prevented the server-side score validation from working. Extensive action logging was added throughout the  to populate  with game events. However, this revealed a , indicating that  was incorrectly initialized as an *object* instead of an *array*.

The current work concluded with the critical fix for . The  constructor and  method were updated to explicitly initialize  as an empty array (). This change is expected to resolve both the  TypeError and ensure that game actions are properly logged, enabling the backend to correctly validate and process scores. The music stacking issue was also addressed by ensuring only one audio system instance initializes and stopping existing music before starting new playback.
