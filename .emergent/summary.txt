The AI engineer successfully transitioned the initial project from a React/FastAPI/MongoDB boilerplate to a Phaser 3 game with a Vite frontend and FastAPI backend, as per the user's detailed . Initial efforts focused on frontend setup, involving a complete refactor from Create React App to Vite, and then implementing the seven core game scenes and mechanics. Significant challenges arose from environment configurations, specifically supervisor scripts not aligning with Vite's build process, and persistent CORS/host blocking issues with the Vite preview server, which were meticulously resolved.

Following the core game, the AI integrated a FastAPI backend to handle content, leaderboards, and anti-cheat score validation. Two major feature sprints were completed, adding polish like deterministic loot wheels, consumables, procedural item naming, and an equip system, alongside content pack updates. The current work is focused on debugging a critical bug where TitleScene buttons are non-functional, identified by the testing agent, immediately after implementing the v1.1.0 sprint features. The AI is systematically investigating this issue.

The overarching goal is to build a mobile-first, browser-based roguelike game called Exit or Die using Phaser 3 and Vite, deployable as a static site on Vercel and itch.io. The game features seven scenes (Boot, Title, Run, LootReveal, GameOver, HighScores, Codex) implementing core mechanics like HP, Greed, deterministic RNG, room modifiers, and a 10-rarity loot system. Backend integration is required for content packs, daily seeds, paginated leaderboards, and server-authoritative score validation via replay logs.

Subsequent updates included:
- **v1.0.2 Polish**: Deterministic roulette wheel, item card pop-ups, procedural flavor text, refined game balance (20-30 room target, 4 starting HP, updated curves, pity system), and consumables (Smoke Bomb, Field Bandage).
- **v1.1.0 Sprint**: Main menu updates (username, custom seed), Safe first two rooms, death-risk smoothing, milestone rooms with boosted drops and forks, equip/bank system for artifacts, procedural item naming (1000+ combinations), HUD cleanup, and backend adjustments for username, custom seeds, and content pack v1.1.0.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer completed the implementation of the comprehensive v1.1.0 sprint features for the Exit or Die game. This included significant updates across the frontend (Phaser scenes, , new , ) and backend (,  data, new endpoints).

After building and restarting the frontend, the AI took a screenshot () which confirmed the visual presence of the new UI elements on the title screen: a  input field, a  input, and a  button, along with the correct  version display.

However, subsequent comprehensive testing by the  revealed a critical bug: the buttons on the title screen (New Run, Daily Run, Play Seed, High Scores, Codex, Options, Fullscreen) are not working. The AI's last action was to inspect the  file to debug this issue and then attempted a different debugging approach by taking another screenshot () to observe if the username/seed inputs were functional, which also indicated the buttons were still unresponsive. The engineer is currently in a debugging loop to identify and fix the cause of the non-functional TitleScene buttons.
